# Ideas and things are made of different stuff

I had an idea. And I think I got it from this book.

This is a book about Kurt Godel and his incompleteness theorem by Douglas Hofstadter.

I'm not going to claim that I fully understand it.

Theorem: 

a general proposition not self-evident but proved by a chain of reasoning; a truth established by means of accepted truths.

You can find statements of the theorem (actually I think there's more than one).  I think the gist is that any system of arithmetic can be shown to prove things that aren't true within that system of arithmentic. 

Something like that.

But we're getting off track, because that's not the realisation, the epiphany, the aha moment, that I had when I was "reading" this book - actually I was listening to it.

The revelation was that numbers and systems of describing numbers are made of different stuff. 

Numbers work in the universe. Languages about numbers are marks on paper, sounds in the air. And, well whatever is going on in our heads.

Numbers and talking about numbers, those are two different things. They're different stuff.

That was the important idea that I took away from this book. Different stuff.

I'm a project manager.

I try to manage turning ideas into things. Ideas and things are different stuff.

And I write about project management, especially the project management of software development.

I've just written a book "Delivering the Impossible" - I'm looking for a publisher.
