\[Jokes about philosophy\]

Socrates
Plato

Ethics - what's right, what's wrong. 
Aesthetics - which is the right tie to wear to this publich execution?
Logic - How do you reason from some things being true to other things being true.
Epistemology - an understanding of why, when a man gets past 50, he's never actually sure whether he wants to pee.
That's a joke. Epistemology is about how we know things.
Ontology - Is there a God? Are there such things as tables? If there aren't where am I going to put my drink?
Philosophy of Science, how we know the earth is flat, moon landings are fake? Just kidding - it's obvious the earth is flat. If it were fizzy we'd seen the bubbles.
Philosophy of Mind - other people have minds. But if people can have minds, how come other things can't have minds? What about a dog? What about a cockroach? What if everything has a mind, just to a different degree? So you have humans, then dogs, then cockroaches, then rocks. And so, really the philosophical question is what comes immediately after rocks? Trump or Elon?

\[Jokes about painting\]

Van Gogh
I'm not sure how to pronounce this, I think it's Van Go - he's white guy the one with the red hair - and one ear. This is not to be confused with the white thing with one door on the side and a VW on the radiator - that's a Van Golf.

Van Gough was obsesses with two things. Painting and having enough money to go to the brothel. It's a pity that he didn't get to make any money out of his success. Because by my calcualtions, if you sell a painting for $22 Million dollars, that's about 44 million trips to the brothel. And with all that sweet sweet gift shop merch money, he wouldn't have been van Gough. He would have been Van Gone. He would have been - Van give me 20 minutes, I think I need a chocolate bar and some fluids.

But it actually might have been a blessing that he died so young, because when he died his sight was starting to fade and it would have been very difficult for him to wear glasses.
