Security check from a security guard who acts like you insulted his mother.



Have to be escorted to the toilet.



Network flat refuses to work with Linux because "security."



It is a truth universally acknowledged that in any group of people in a room one will be blue, shivering and frozen, another will be sweating like they're in a Bangkok drunk tank.
