<p>So the social media challenge for today was talk about my new idea - biscuit tins and biscuits - in terms of a book that I’d already read. And also, to do it with a resigned attitude.</p>
<p>The book I’m going to talk about is hierarchies and markets by Oliver Williamson. Willson’s idea is that hierarchical organisations are far more resilient in the face of risks that markets.</p>
<p>The fact that they’re resilient to risks means that they’re more efficient, and this is why large organisations form. It’s also why some kinds of tasks can only be taken on by the biggest kinds of organisation - the state.</p>
<p>Most people in an organisation spend their time talking “organisation” language. Because they don’t work on the “edges” of the organisation that actually deal with the organisations customers. This means that what the organisation does - whether it’s selling burgers, or collectiong (and spending) taxes isn’t actually what the organisation does.</p>
<p>It’s even weirder than that though. Because if everybody in the organisation <em>did</em> work in service of the “edges,” i.e. they just made burgers or collected taxes, rather than working in HR and concentrating on moving up a hierarchy and office in-fighting, Williamson’s point is that <em>that</em> organisation would be weaker!</p>
<p>So here’s the resigned attitude. Hierarchies are in some really imporant sense <em>better</em> than markets for weathering storms and being efficient at getting things done.</p>
<p>And there’s something similar going on with the biscuit tin and the biscuit. Biscuit tin language has to be what gets bandied around inside organisations (those same hierarchies) biscuit tin language will be what gets you money to do a project. But at some point it has to connect to the biscuit, the real thing that goes off it’s not stored properly, has to contain only ingredients that don’t kill people and has to taste good. And like in hierarchies and markets, this is always going to be an awkward boundary. There’s always going to be a temptation to not take enough care of it.</p>
<p>There’s nothing you can do about most of this - and there really isn’t anything you <em>should</em> do. But there are key points where you need to talk in terms of “Market language” - i.e. what the customers want. And also “biscuit language” - what the product actually does, what it needs to actually perform.</p>
