You see things other people donâ€™t.

You always have.

The problem isâ€¦

You assume they see it too.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

You assume theyâ€™ll get there on their own.

You assume that someone else, 
someone louder, someone braver, someone with more talent or tenure,
someone with a title or more cred,
will say what youâ€™re too afraid to say.

But they wonâ€™t.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Because they donâ€™t see what you see.

They canâ€™t. 

Thatâ€™s your job.
Thatâ€™s why youâ€™re here.

Not to follow.
Not to just â€˜go with the flowâ€™.
Not to support from the sidelines.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

To be a lighthouse.

To stand tall in what you know.
To own your hard-won experience. 
To live from the centre of your fabulous self. 

To speak the truth when no one else can.

To shine so bright that others can finally see the way forward.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

If you stay silent, 
they stay lost.

And so do you. 

Itâ€™s time to turn the light on.
