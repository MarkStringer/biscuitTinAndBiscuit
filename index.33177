<p>So the social media challenge for today was talk about my new idea - biscuit tins and biscuits - in terms of a book that Iâd already read. And also, to do it with a resigned attitude.</p>
<p>The book Iâm going to talk about is hierarchies and markets by Oliver Williamson. Willsonâs idea is that hierarchical organisations are far more resilient in the face of risks that markets.</p>
<p>The fact that theyâre resilient to risks means that theyâre more efficient, and this is why large organisations form. Itâs also why some kinds of tasks can only be taken on by the biggest kinds of organisation - the state.</p>
<p>Most people in an organisation spend their time talking âorganisationâ language. Because they donât work on the âedgesâ of the organisation that actually deal with the organisations customers. This means that what the organisation does - whether itâs selling burgers, or collectiong (and spending) taxes isnât actually what the organisation does.</p>
<p>Itâs even weirder than that though. Because if everybody in the organisation <em>did</em> work in service of the âedges,â i.e.Â they just made burgers or collected taxes, rather than working in HR and concentrating on moving up a hierarchy and office in-fighting, Williamsonâs point is that <em>that</em> organisation would be weaker!</p>
<p>So hereâs the resigned attitude. Hierarchies are in some really imporant sense <em>better</em> than markets for weathering storms and being efficient at getting things done.</p>
<p>And thereâs something similar going on with the biscuit tin and the biscuit. Biscuit tin language has to be what gets bandied around inside organisations (those same hierarchies) biscuit tin language will be what gets you money to do a project. But at some point it has to connect to the biscuit, the real thing that goes off itâs not stored properly, has to contain only ingredients that donât kill people and has to taste good. And like in hierarchies and markets, this is always going to be an awkward boundary. Thereâs always going to be a temptation to not take enough care of it.</p>
<p>Thereâs nothing you can do about most of this - and there really isnât anything you <em>should</em> do. But there are key points where you need to talk in terms of âMarket languageâ - i.e.Â what the customers want. And also âbiscuit languageâ - what the product actually does, what it needs to actually perform.</p>
