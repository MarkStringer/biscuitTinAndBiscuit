Mark Stringer is a philosopher, stand-up comedian and project manager. For the last fifteen years he's been helping people get what they want. He's been managing people's projects. He's been thinking about why giving people what they want is so difficult. And then he's been trying to tell jokes about it to take away the pain.

He realised one thing far too late. Things and descriptions of things are made of different stuff. And the way that we feel about one, isn't really much of a guide about how we'll feel about the other. The biscuit tin isn't the biscuit.
